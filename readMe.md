# \@Ease

\@Ease is a MEAN stack application for massage therapists to keep track of their patients and appointments.

After creating an account, the user has the option to create patients, appointments, and notes for each appointment.   
The notes and diagrams created on \@Ease are centered around an interactive interface.  The user is presented with front and back human diagram.  On the diagram the user can click on an area and an image corresponding to the pain type will appear highlighting the area.

The user also has the option to send reminder emails or texts to their patients using the patient's contact information.

\@Ease utilizes:
* MongoDb
* AngularJS
* Express
* Node.js
* HTML5 canvas
* Twilio
* Nodemailer
* X-editable
* Bootstrap
* SweetAlert2
* JavaScript ES6

I have begun to use this project as a testing ground for automated testing of my API using Mocha.js
